# SysML2.0

Supports the specification, analysis, design, and verification and validation 
of complex systems that may include hardware, software, information, 
processes, personnel, and facilities

If you have been keeping track of the SysML v2 developments, you probably already know this. This week I decided to give it a try. If, like me, you are a practitioner of MBSE and SysML and are interested in getting a sense of what is coming up with SysML v2 and how you might try it.

As a first attempt, I started making a simple model of a Flashlight. I started by creating a new project, checking the “sysml.library” project on the Project References page. I also converted the project to an Xtext project, as required to set up indexing infrastructure for resolving references.
